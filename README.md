Biznext is a state-of-the-art B2B2C Digital Platform, under the parent SaaS based Company VK Venture Pvt Ltd. registered under the Start-up India program.

We are a 10-year-old company currently focused on developing cutting edge technology to enable Fintech solutions. Our primary goal is to make India financially inclusive by catering to scarcity of financial connectivity in tier II/III cities of India. The organization has previously served in sectors of travel, telecommunications and e-commerce.

We, at Biznext, enable local retail stores to offer Assisted Digital Financial Services like Cash Deposit, Cash Withdrawal, Balance Inquiry, Bill Payments, Micro ATM, Aadhaar Enabled Services (AEPS), DTH-Mobile Recharges, POS Services, SMS Payment, Insurance, Money Transfer etc.

We have leveraged artificial intelligence in our technology to make these financial transactions seamless, quick and simple. We continuously keep iterating our solutions and adapting changes as per feedback of our 35,000-active partner-network to develop this secure platform which offers a significantly superior user experience.

Every day we are inching closer to our goal of transforming tier II/III stores into a one-stop solution for all digital and financial services. These stores will act as an enabler to digitize cash for the customers visiting their outlets thereby empowering greater financial connectivity in semi urban and rural regions across India. We are working on enhancing the portfolio of our authorized partners by continuously adding new services where they earn maximum income with minimum investmen****
